              models. The Long Range variant delivers up to 330 miles of range
              on a single charge, while the Performance model can accelerate
              from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds. Both variants come with
              dual-motor all-wheel drive, providing excellent traction and
              control. Minimalist, High-Tech Interior: The interior of the Model
              Y is modern and minimal, dominated by a 15-inch touchscreen that
              controls virtually all vehicle functions, including navigation,
              climate control, media, and driving settings. It supports
              over-the-air software updates, which continuously add new features
              and improve existing ones. The cabin is spacious, offering seating
              for up to seven passengers with an optional third-row
              configuration. Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability: The
              Model Y comes with Autopilot, Tesla's advanced driver-assistance
              system that includes features like adaptive cruise control,
              lane-keeping assist, and automatic lane changes. For an additional
              cost, you can opt for Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability, which
              adds even more autonomous features, such as navigating on
              highways, automatic parking, and traffic light recognition (though
              full autonomy is still under regulatory approval). Safety: Tesla
              emphasizes safety, and the Model Y is no exception. It has a
              5-star safety rating from the NHTSA and comes with standard
              features like automatic emergency braking, collision warning, and
              blind-spot monitoring. Its low center of gravity (thanks to the
              battery placement) and rigid structure also enhance its crash
              protection. Spacious Cargo Area: One of the Model Y’s strong
              points is its cargo capacity. With up to 68 cubic feet of storage
              space, the Model Y is one of the most spacious compact SUVs in its
              class. The rear seats can fold down flat to create a large loading
              area, and there is also a front trunk (frunk) for additional
              storage. Charging and Efficiency: The Model Y is compatible with
              Tesla’s expansive Supercharger network, which allows for fast
              charging on long road trips. It can charge from 10% to 80% in
              about 30 minutes at a Supercharger. It also supports home charging
              via a Tesla Wall Connector, making it convenient for daily use.

            <h4>Volkswagen ID.4</h4>
            <p>
              Electric Powertrain: The ID.4 comes with a rear-mounted electric
              motor, delivering up to 201 horsepower in its base models and 295
              horsepower in the dual-motor all-wheel-drive variants. With an
              estimated range of 250 to 275 miles on a single charge, the ID.4
              offers sufficient range for both daily commutes and longer trips.
              Modern, Sleek Design: The ID.4 has a futuristic yet understated
              design, with smooth lines, LED lighting, and a minimalist
              exterior. The SUV has a streamlined shape for better aerodynamics,
              enhancing its efficiency. Spacious and Tech-Forward Interior:
              Inside, the ID.4 boasts a roomy, open cabin with ample headroom
              and legroom for passengers. The interior design is clean and
              modern, with sustainable materials used in some trims. A large 10
              to 12-inch touchscreen controls the infotainment system, which
              includes features like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and wireless
              charging. Advanced Safety Features: The ID.4 is equipped with
              Volkswagen’s IQ.Drive suite of driver-assistance technologies.
              This includes adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist,
              automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring, providing
              a safe and confident driving experience. Charging: The ID.4
              supports both home charging (Level 2) and fast charging (DC fast
              charging), where it can recharge up to 80% of its battery in about
              30-40 minutes using a fast charger. Eco-Friendly and Affordable:
              As an electric vehicle, the ID.4 produces zero emissions, making
              it environmentally friendly. It also qualifies for various
              government incentives and rebates, which can make it more
              affordable compared to conventional SUVs.
